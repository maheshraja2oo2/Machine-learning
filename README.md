# Machine-learning

This Python code processes a chronic kidney disease (CKD) dataset by cleaning and encoding the data, handling missing values, and analyzing feature correlations. It then trains a Decision Tree Classifier to predict CKD and prepares other models for comparison. The goal is to create a reliable model to predict the presence of CKD based on medical data.
